## Summary

I decided to modify an umbrella into SOLAR UMBRELLA. I will use solar fabric/solar panel in the umbrella. 
It can also help street vendor alot. It will fulfill all their basic neccessities like light,fan and switchboard or charging electrical appliances like mobile phones.
I am excited to make this because they struggle alot in scorching heat to earn some money. They also have to spend extra money on buying leds and batteries. And I will
also learn many things while making this project.

## Plan

I will use solar fabric/solar panel in the umbrella
All the energy that is collected by the solar fabric will be stored in the lithium batteries and will be further used in all the components of the umbrella. 
The stored energy will be used by fan and light. When temperature rises up to 30 degree Celsius, by the help of digital temperature and humidity sensor the fan will
automatically start with the help of Arduino. For glowing the led, I will use LDR Sensor which will help the sirius solar led to glow when the surroundings are dark   
and when the surroundings are light then the led will not glow. An attachment of switch board will be added to the umbrella which will get energy from the 
lithium batteries. It will help the street vendors for charging their electrical appliances.

Firstly, I will use solar fabric/solar panel in the umbrella.
Secondly, I will connect solar fabric cloth to the lithium batteries so that the energy from the cloth will be transfered to lithium batteries and it will be stored there.
Thirdly, I will connect all the components[ Fan,Sirius solar led,Switch board,ldr sensor and Digital temperature and humidity sensor] to the lithium batteries.
Fourthly, I will connect the fan with the digital temperature and humidity sensor.
Lastly, I will connect the sirius solar led with ldr sensor.

## Budget

What materials will you need for your project? Where will you get them? How much does it cost? Please include all materials, including components you already own. Make sure to factor in shipping costs and sales tax.
